# Zodiacs SDK

Zodiacs SDK is the official read-only TypeScript interface for the canonical
Zodiacs.org registry. The native Zodiacs assets are SPL tokens on Solana. The
SDK also recognizes official bridged ERC-20 representations on Base, created to
make the original Solana Zodiacs accessible in Coinbase's Base ecosystem.

Apps can use the SDK to verify official Zodiacs addresses, read public
ownership state, render sign metadata, and build cultural identity interfaces.

## Official Zodiacs.org Registry

The registry models the twelve signs as one canonical asset universe:

- one asset identity per sign
- one native Solana SPL mint per sign
- one official bridged Base ERC-20 representation per sign
- provenance from every Base representation back to its Solana origin

Machine-readable registry artifact:

```txt
packages/sdk/registry/zodiacs.registry.json
```

## Install

```sh
pnpm add @zodiacs/sdk
```

For Base read-only balance helpers, the SDK uses `viem` public clients. For
Solana read-only balance helpers, it uses `@solana/web3.js` connections.

## Verify an Address

```ts
import {
  getNativeCounterpart,
  getRepresentationByAddress,
  isOfficialZodiacAddress
} from "@zodiacs/sdk";

const address = "0x3ffB5282F5891Dd8c813E64059EdB0607537eC91";

const isOfficial = isOfficialZodiacAddress(address);
const representation = getRepresentationByAddress(address);
const native = getNativeCounterpart(address);

console.log(isOfficial);
console.log(representation?.kind); // "bridged"
console.log(native?.chain); // "solana"
```

Unknown addresses return `false` or `null`. Assertion helpers throw typed
errors only when an app explicitly asks for assertion behavior.

## Get a Zodiac Asset

```ts
import {
  getBaseZodiacRepresentation,
  getSolanaZodiacRepresentation,
  getZodiacAsset
} from "@zodiacs/sdk";

const aries = getZodiacAsset("aries");
const native = getSolanaZodiacRepresentation("aries");
const bridged = getBaseZodiacRepresentation("aries");

console.log(aries.displayName);
console.log(native.address);
console.log(bridged.originAddress === native.address);
```

## Read Solana Holdings

```ts
import { Connection } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { getSolanaZodiacsOwnership } from "@zodiacs/sdk";

const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");

const ownership = await getSolanaZodiacsOwnership(
  connection,
  "CWKQJJYec89wcx871C8vmyTPc3jhsdoAYs5aGffUtELJ"
);
```

Compatibility aliases remain available:

- `getZodiacBalance`
- `getZodiacsOwnership`
- `getHeldZodiacs`

These default to the native Solana representation. New integrations should
prefer the explicit `getSolana*` names.

## Read Base Holdings

```ts
import { createPublicClient, http } from "viem";
import { base } from "viem/chains";
import { getBaseZodiacsOwnership } from "@zodiacs/sdk";

const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: base,
  transport: http()
});

const ownership = await getBaseZodiacsOwnership(
  publicClient,
  "0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111"
);
```

Base helpers use `PublicClient` only. They read ERC-20 `balanceOf` and
`decimals`; they do not construct transactions or require wallet clients.

## Build a Cross-Chain Zodiac Shelf

```ts
import {
  getCrossChainZodiacsOwnership,
  getUnifiedZodiacShelf
} from "@zodiacs/sdk";

const ownershipByChain = await getCrossChainZodiacsOwnership({
  solana: { connection, ownerAddress: "CWKQJJYec89wcx871C8vmyTPc3jhsdoAYs5aGffUtELJ" },
  base: { publicClient, ownerAddress: "0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111" }
});

const shelf = await getUnifiedZodiacShelf({
  solana: { connection, ownerAddress: "CWKQJJYec89wcx871C8vmyTPc3jhsdoAYs5aGffUtELJ" },
  base: { publicClient, ownerAddress: "0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111" }
});

console.log(shelf.label); // "combined wallet holdings across official representations"
console.log(ownershipByChain.base?.heldSigns);
```

Cross-chain helpers expose per-chain holdings first. They do not treat bridged
Base balances as independent new supply.

## React Components

```tsx
import {
  OfficialZodiacBadge,
  ZodiacAddressVerifier,
  ZodiacsProvider
} from "@zodiacs/sdk";

export function RegistrySurface() {
  return (
    <ZodiacsProvider rpcUrl="https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com">
      <OfficialZodiacBadge address="0x3ffB5282F5891Dd8c813E64059EdB0607537eC91" />
      <ZodiacAddressVerifier address="0x3ffB5282F5891Dd8c813E64059EdB0607537eC91" />
    </ZodiacsProvider>
  );
}
```

Verifier UI distinguishes:

- Official native Zodiacs.org asset on Solana
- Official bridged Zodiacs.org asset on Base
- Not found in the official Zodiacs.org registry

## Optional Market Context

Market data is optional display context. It is not required by the registry,
verifier, ownership, or identity helpers. DEX Screener and Jupiter endpoints
are upstream-controlled; adapters accept `config.endpoint` for integrations
that need to pin or replace an upstream URL.

Market helpers are representation-aware, so apps can request context for a
Solana native representation or a Base bridged representation without implying
one universal cross-chain price.

## Security Posture

Zodiacs SDK is read-only infrastructure. It does not request private keys, sign
messages, connect wallets, submit transactions, provide custody, or provide
transaction approval helpers.

The package is intended for verification, public balance reads, metadata, and
identity surfaces.

## What This SDK Does Not Do

The SDK does not provide asset movement, exchange, staking, reward, or claim
flows. It does not provide financial guarantees, rankings, or promotional
claims.

## Versioning

`@zodiacs/sdk` follows semver. The canonical registry has its own version field
inside `ZODIACS_REGISTRY` and `packages/sdk/registry/zodiacs.registry.json`.

## Contributing

Keep changes app-neutral and read-only. Registry changes should preserve the
model that Solana SPL mints are the native originals and Base ERC-20 addresses
are official bridged representations.
